Machine learning is a field that uses algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. Practically, this means that we can feed data into an algorithm, and use it to make predictions about what might happen in the future. This has a vast range of applications, from self-driving cars to stock price prediction. Not only is machine learning interesting, it's also starting to be widely used, making it an extremely practical skill to learn.
Python has an amazing ecosystem of libraries that make machine learning easy to get started with.like scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries

### 2.[Python Date and Time](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/Python%20Date%20and%20Time.py)
A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.

### 3.[Python Functions](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/function.py)
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.A function can return data as a result.In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

### 4.[Python Error and Exceptions](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/Exceptions)
Until now error messages haven’t been more than mentioned, but if you have tried out the examples you have probably seen some. There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.

### 5.[Python Modules](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/IPYNB/Module.ipynb)
Consider a module to be the same as a code library.A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py

### 6.[File Handling](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/IPYNB/File%20handling.ipynb)
Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.
Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a file object.

### 7.[Regular Expression](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/IPYNB/Regular%2Bexpression.ipynb)
A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.

### 8.[Os Modules in Python](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/blob/master/IPYNB/OS%2BModule.ipynb)
The OS module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

### 9.[ML Intro (Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib)](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/ML)
NumPy stands for ‘Numerical Python’ or ‘Numeric Python’. It is an open source module of Python which provides fast mathematical computation on arrays and matrices.

Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools.

Matplotlib is a 2d plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, Python and IPython shell, Jupyter Notebook, web application servers and GUI toolkits.

### 10.[Object Oriented Programming in Python](https://github.com/sam2702/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/master/OOPs)
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.
